Readme
This is an open source project to exemplify some frontend programming. This is only a single small page that utilizes different components for the development.

It uses Vue.js as the default framework of programming language and TailwindCSS for the styles.

SQL Queries
As is it an example project, some pieces of the page won't work. This example has the main propose to show how we can create an page using components and create a simple and elegant layout.

If we would turn this in to a software would be necessary to do some coding to add some features as:

- Connect to different databases
- Save queries for the logged user
- Export the content based on the current query
- Query the info with the backend based changes
- Add functionalities to check table schemas, backup, configurations and lots more.
  I created some standart queries for this example. You can play around with the editor or use the following to display results:

SELECT \* FROM users
