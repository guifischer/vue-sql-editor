# SQL Queries

Since it is an example project, some pieces of the page won't work. This example has the main propose to show how we can create an page using components and create a simple and elegant layout.

If we would turn this in to a software would be necessary to do some coding to add some features as:

- Connect to different databases
- Save queries for the logged user
- Export the content based on the current query
- Query the info with the backend based changes
- Add functionalities to check table schemas, backup, configurations and lots more.
  I created some standart queries for this example. You can play around with the editor or use the following to display results:

```
SELECT * FROM categories
```

```
SELECT * FROM orders
```

```
SELECT * FROM products
```
